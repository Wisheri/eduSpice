### Preparations

  * Group in pairs

---

### Script

#### Be a function round 1: Do things

* Player 1 gets to be function with some name and rule.
* Player 2 tries to guess what is the rule in question.
* When ready, Player 1 gets to be function and Player 2 is the one guessing.
* At some point students can make their own rules.

### Functions

#### 1 Do things

* Name: DoAction
* Rule: When "DoAction" called, raise your hand up. Keep it there for 5 seconds. Don't do anything else.


#### 2 Return something

* Name: MyFunction
* Rule: When "MyFunction" called, say "You called function MyFunction. Thank you, your number is 2". Don't do anything else.

#### 3 With variable

* Name: HelloName (insert any name to name)
* Rule: When "HelloName" is called with some name, say "Hello {name}, nice to meet you." If no name is given say "Hello, nice to meet you."

#### 4 Math function

* Name: TakeNumber x (insert number to x)
Rule: When "TakeNumber" is called with some number, multiply it with two and add 1 to it. Say the result of the calculation. If "TakeNumber" is called without number do nothing.

#### 5 Random

* Name: GiveNumber x (insert number to x)
* Rule: When "GiveNumber" is called with some number or not, return any number you want to.

#### 6 Free - make your own
* Name: Pick a name you want to
* Rule: Make a rule of your own.


### Questions to think about

* How would you describe function - what it is?
* What is the difference between functions in math and functions in programming?
* Think what kind of functions you had in the exercise - how did they differ from one another?
