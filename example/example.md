### Preparations
  * Print the [empty grid](https://github.com/futurice/eduSpice/blob/master/example/empty_grid.md) for everybody
  * Print the [example grid](https://github.com/futurice/eduSpice/blob/master/example/example_grid.md) for everybody
  * Prepare grid in the class room floor with tape or string
  * Choose obstacles (they can be what ever that fit to the square of grid)
  * Plan few different grids with obstacles
---

### Script

#### Planning the route

* Give students the example grid paper
* Instruct them to write or draw instructions to the paper (if drawn they can do it with arrows for example)
* Instructions They can use are: Move forward, Turn left or Turn Right

### Testing the route

* After planning the route let students try their route in the grid made to class floor
* Alternatively they can draw the route with pen to their own paper or on a blank example grid
* If they find bugs they can fix them and try again

### Designing new grids

* After Testing their route students can design new places for obstacles and test their route plan again
* Usually after this the old route doesn't work anymore, so they have to plan new one

### Questions to think

* Is there impossible grids?
* Is some plan invincible?
* How could the plan be made better? (could we use conditions?)
