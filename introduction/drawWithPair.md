### Script

#### Draw with pair

* Group in pairs
* Player 1 draws a picture to the paper. Make sure that Player 2 doesn't see it.
* Player 1 gives orders to Player 2 how to draw the same picture again. Again make sure that Player 1 doesn't see what Player 2 draws.
* When ready, compare the results and see if they are similar on not.
* Do it the other way around.


#### Questions to think about

* How did the drawings differ?
* What was easy to describe and what was difficult?
* How could you make it better?
* With computers you also have to be exact while giving instructions.
